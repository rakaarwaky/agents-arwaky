# GitHub Pull Request Workflow

Complete guide for managing the PR lifecycle. Each section shows the `gh` way first, then the `git` + `curl` fallback for machines without `gh`.

## Prerequisites

- Authenticated with GitHub (see `github-auth` skill)
- Inside a git repository with a GitHub remote

### Quick Auth Detection

Auth, token resolution, and owner/repo extraction all live in `github-auth`'s
helper — source it rather than re-implementing the fallback chain (it also
resolves from `~/.qwen`, `~/.hermes`, or `~/.config/opencode` pack roots):

```bash
for R in "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/skills" "$HOME/.qwen/skills" "$HOME/.config/opencode/skills" "$HOME/agents-arwaky/skills"; do
  [ -f "$R/github/github-auth/scripts/gh-env.sh" ] && source "$R/github/github-auth/scripts/gh-env.sh" && break
done
AUTH="$GH_AUTH_METHOD"; OWNER_REPO="$GH_OWNER_REPO"; OWNER="$GH_OWNER"; REPO="$GH_REPO"
echo "Using: $AUTH"; echo "Owner: $OWNER, Repo: $REPO"
```

---

## 1. Branch Creation

This part is pure `git` — identical either way:

```bash
# Make sure you're up to date
git fetch origin
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feat/add-user-authentication
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feat/description` — new features
- `fix/description` — bug fixes
- `refactor/description` — code restructuring
- `docs/description` — documentation
- `ci/description` — CI/CD changes

## 2. Making Commits

Use the agent's file tools (`write_file`, `patch`) to make changes, then commit:

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add src/auth.py src/models/user.py tests/test_auth.py

# Commit with a conventional commit message
git commit -m "feat: add JWT-based user authentication

- Add login/register endpoints
- Add User model with password hashing
- Add auth middleware for protected routes
- Add unit tests for auth flow"
```

Commit message format (Conventional Commits):
```
type(scope): short description

Longer explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `chore`, `perf`

## 3. Pushing and Creating a PR

### Push the Branch (same either way)

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### Create the PR

**With gh:**

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: add JWT-based user authentication" \
  --body "## Summary
- Adds login and register API endpoints
- JWT token generation and validation

## Test Plan
- [ ] Unit tests pass

Closes #42"
```

Options: `--draft`, `--reviewer user1,user2`, `--label "enhancement"`, `--base develop`

For anything longer than a few lines, fill the matching skeleton and pass it with `--body-file` instead of an inline `--body`: [`templates/pr-body-feature.md`](templates/pr-body-feature.md) or [`templates/pr-body-bugfix.md`](templates/pr-body-bugfix.md).

**With git + curl:**

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls \
  -d "{
    \"title\": \"feat: add JWT-based user authentication\",
    \"body\": \"## Summary\nAdds login and register API endpoints.\n\nCloses #42\",
    \"head\": \"$BRANCH\",
    \"base\": \"main\"
  }"
```

The response JSON includes the PR `number` — save it for later commands.

To create as a draft, add `"draft": true` to the JSON body.

## 4. Monitoring CI Status

### Check CI Status

**With gh:**

```bash
# One-shot check
gh pr checks

# Watch until all checks finish (polls every 10s)
gh pr checks --watch
```

**With git + curl:**

```bash
# Get the latest commit SHA on the current branch
SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# Query the combined status
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/commits/$SHA/status \
  | python -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f\"Overall: {data['state']}\")
for s in data.get('statuses', []):
    print(f\"  {s['context']}: {s['state']} - {s.get('description', '')}\")"

# Also check GitHub Actions check runs (separate endpoint)
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/commits/$SHA/check-runs \
  | python -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for cr in data.get('check_runs', []):
    print(f\"  {cr['name']}: {cr['status']} / {cr['conclusion'] or 'pending'}\")"
```

### Poll Until Complete (git + curl)

```bash
# Simple polling loop — check every 30 seconds, up to 10 minutes
SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
for i in $(seq 1 20); do
  STATUS=$(curl -s \
    -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/commits/$SHA/status \
    | python -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['state'])")
  echo "Check $i: $STATUS"
  if [ "$STATUS" = "success" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "failure" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "error" ]; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 30
done
```

## 5. Auto-Fixing CI Failures

When CI fails, diagnose and fix. This loop works with either auth method.

### Step 1: Get Failure Details

**With gh:**

```bash
# List recent workflow runs on this branch
gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 5

# View failed logs
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed
```

**With git + curl:**

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# List workflow runs on this branch
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/actions/runs?branch=$BRANCH&per_page=5" \
  | python -c "
import sys, json
runs = json.load(sys.stdin)['workflow_runs']
for r in runs:
    print(f\"Run {r['id']}: {r['name']} - {r['conclusion'] or r['status']}\")"

# Get failed job logs (download as zip, extract, read)
RUN_ID=<run_id>
curl -s -L \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/actions/runs/$RUN_ID/logs \
  -o /tmp/ci-logs.zip
cd /tmp && unzip -o ci-logs.zip -d ci-logs && cat ci-logs/*.txt
```

### Step 2: Fix and Push

After identifying the issue, use file tools (`patch`, `write_file`) to fix it:

```bash
git add <fixed_files>
git commit -m "fix: resolve CI failure in <check_name>"
git push
```

### Step 3: Verify

Re-check CI status using the commands from Section 4 above.

### Auto-Fix Loop Pattern

When asked to auto-fix CI, follow this loop:

1. Check CI status → identify failures
2. Read failure logs → understand the error
3. Use `read_file` + `patch`/`write_file` → fix the code
4. `git add . && git commit -m "fix: ..." && git push`
5. Wait for CI → re-check status
6. Repeat if still failing (up to 3 attempts, then ask the user)

## 6. Merging

**With gh:**

```bash
# Squash merge + delete branch (cleanest for feature branches)
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

# Enable auto-merge (merges when all checks pass)
gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch
```

**With git + curl:**

```bash
PR_NUMBER=<number>

# Merge the PR via API (squash)
curl -s -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/merge \
  -d "{
    \"merge_method\": \"squash\",
    \"commit_title\": \"feat: add user authentication (#$PR_NUMBER)\"
  }"

# Delete the remote branch after merge
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
git push origin --delete $BRANCH

# Switch back to main locally
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git branch -d $BRANCH
```

Merge methods: `"merge"` (merge commit), `"squash"`, `"rebase"`

### Enable Auto-Merge (curl)

```bash
# Auto-merge requires the repo to have it enabled in settings.
# This uses the GraphQL API since REST doesn't support auto-merge.
PR_NODE_ID=$(curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER \
  | python -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['node_id'])")

curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/graphql \
  -d "{\"query\": \"mutation { enablePullRequestAutoMerge(input: {pullRequestId: \\\"$PR_NODE_ID\\\", mergeMethod: SQUASH}) { clientMutationId } }\"}"
```

## 7. Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start from clean main
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# 2. Branch
git checkout -b fix/login-redirect-bug

# 3. (Agent makes code changes with file tools)

# 4. Commit
git add src/auth/login.py tests/test_login.py
git commit -m "fix: correct redirect URL after login

Preserves the ?next= parameter instead of always redirecting to /dashboard."

# 5. Push
git push -u origin HEAD

# 6. Create PR (picks gh or curl based on what's available)
# ... (see Section 3)

# 7. Monitor CI (see Section 4)

# 8. Merge when green (see Section 6)
```

## Taking an Issue to a PR

Turn a GitHub issue into a tested, verified PR. This section owns the end-to-end
discipline — premise validation, duplicate sweeps, class-level fixes, and honest CI
reporting; the sibling skills own their own mechanics. Use it for "Fix issue #123 and
open a PR", "Implement this GitHub feature request", "Take this bug from issue to green
CI". Don't use it for reviewing an existing PR (see `github-code-review`) or answering a
code question with no requested change.

### 1. Read the live issue — body AND full thread

Use `terminal` to run `gh issue view <N> --comments`. The body is a snapshot from filing time; the newest comments carry the live state: partial fixes already merged, new root-cause analyses, maintainer decisions, or questions directed at you that change the task. Also read repository instructions (`AGENTS.md`, contribution docs) with `read_file`. Done when the currently requested behavior, non-goals, and any unanswered thread questions are known.

### 2. Sweep for existing and duplicate work

Before writing anything, run `gh pr list --search "#<N>" --state all` plus at least two keyword/synonym variants of the symptom (`gh pr list --search "<subsystem> <symptom>" --state open`). Popular issues attract multiple independent fixes; building a duplicate wastes the work and the credit. Also check whether a recent commit already fixed it: `git log --oneline -20 -- <relevant files>`. Done when you know every open PR and recent commit touching this issue, or that none exist.

### 3. Validate the premise against current code — and against design intent

Reproduce the bug or demonstrate the missing behavior on the current default branch with a failing test or fixture, using `search_files` and `read_file` to trace the reported path. Then check the second question: is the "bug" actually deliberate design? Run `git log -p -S "<symbol>"` on the code the issue wants changed and read the original commit's intent — a missing link or restriction is often the feature. Challenge stale or flawed issue prose instead of implementing it blindly. Done when the root cause or feature gap is demonstrated in current code AND the change doesn't fight an intentional design.

### 4. Define acceptance and risk

List acceptance criteria, interfaces, migrations/state changes, compatibility, security/privacy, rollout, and rollback. Map every criterion to a test or explicit verification. Done when review has a finite contract.

### 5. Implement the smallest complete change — and fix the class

Work on an isolated branch or worktree (Section 1), loading `systematic-debugging` or `test-driven-development` when the bug class calls for them. Add regression tests first, then implement. When the fix is in hand, `search_files` for the same bug shape at sibling call sites and fix the whole class in this PR — an incomplete fix that leaves known siblings broken is worse than none. Every changed line must trace to the issue; no drive-by cleanup. Done when targeted tests pass, the original failure no longer reproduces, and sibling sites are fixed or explicitly ruled out.

### 6. Prove the regression test bites (sabotage run)

Temporarily restore the old behavior of the exact function under test, run the new test, and confirm it FAILS; then restore the fix and confirm it passes. A regression test that passes with and without the fix proves nothing. Done when the test demonstrably fails on pre-fix code.

### 7. Run repository quality gates, then open the PR immediately

Run the formatter, lint, typecheck, and the repo's canonical test entrypoint on affected areas; use `requesting-code-review` on the diff. Then push and open the PR right away — the PR is what dispatches CI, and CI latency is the long pole; do not sit on finished work. Use Sections 1–3 above for PR mechanics: conventional branch/commit, body linking the issue with problem, approach, tests, risk, and exclusions. Read the PR back and verify head SHA, base, title, and files. Done when the PR exists with the intended diff and CI is running.

### 8. Shepherd CI honestly and close the loop

Inspect live checks and failure logs via `gh pr checks` / `gh run view --log-failed` (Section 4–5). Distinguish failures introduced by your diff from pre-existing baseline or infrastructure failures — reproduce on the default branch when unsure, and rerun once only for genuine infra flakes. Never say "green," "merged," or "released" without live evidence of that exact state. When the PR lands, comment on the issue with the PR link and a one-line explanation so the reporter gets a traceable resolution. Done when CI state, remaining blockers, and the issue thread all reflect reality.

### Pitfalls (issue → PR)

- Coding before reading issue comments, sweeping for duplicate PRs, or reading current code.
- "Fixing" behavior that the original commit shows is intentional design.
- Fixing a symptom at one call site while sibling sites keep the same bug.
- Shipping a regression test that also passes without the fix.
- Opening a PR with unrun tests or unrelated formatting churn.
- Claiming the issue is delivered because a PR exists.

### Verification (issue → PR)

- [ ] Full issue thread read; newest comment state reflected in the plan.
- [ ] Duplicate-PR sweep run with issue number + 2 keyword variants.
- [ ] Premise reproduced on current code; design intent checked via git history.
- [ ] Regression test proven to fail without the fix.
- [ ] Sibling call sites fixed or explicitly ruled out.
- [ ] Every changed line traces to the issue.
- [ ] CI state reported from live evidence only; issue commented with the PR link.
