# Competitor News Monitor — Setup

**Goal:** a watch contract exists and a cron job is scheduled for the tick.

## 1. Freeze the watchlist

Record canonical company names, domains, products, aliases, geography/language, event categories, cadence, audience, and materiality threshold. Done when a candidate article can be accepted or rejected consistently.

## 2. Build source coverage, then schedule

For each company include, where available:

1. official newsroom/blog and changelog
2. pricing/product pages
3. regulatory filings and investor relations
4. status/security pages
5. reputable trade and financial press
6. job postings as weak supporting evidence

Use `blogwatcher` (optional, stateful) for feeds, and `web_search`/`web_extract` for pages. Write the watch contract (watchlist, categories, materiality threshold, last cutoff) to a state file under `~/.hermes/competitor-watches/<watch-slug>.json`, then create the job:

```text
cronjob(action="create",
        schedule="every monday 9am",
        prompt="Load the competitor-news-monitor skill and run the tick for the watch contract at ~/.hermes/competitor-watches/<watch-slug>.json.",
        deliver=<user's destination>)
```

Done when each requested event category has at least one intended primary source or a documented gap, and the job exists.

## Completion

- The watch contract file exists at `~/.hermes/competitor-watches/<watch-slug>.json` with all fields filled.
- A cron job is created and visible in the job list.
