# Step 6: Guardrails — Red Flags & Rationalizations

The two guardrail tables that apply across every step. Step 0 points here when a red flag triggers; Step 5 runs the final pass against this table before reporting done.

## Red Flags — STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:

- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **Each fix reveals a new problem in a different place**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Step 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (Step 4 §6).

## Common Rationalizations

Debugging and TDD excuses, deduped into one table:

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" / "Tests after achieve same goals" | Untested fixes don't stick, and tests written after code pass immediately — they prove nothing. Tests-after answer "what does this do?"; tests-first answer "what should this do?". |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question the pattern, don't fix again. |
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "Already manually tested" | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run. |
| "Deleting X hours is wasteful" | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is technical debt. |
| "Keep as reference, write tests first" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. |
| "Need to explore first" | Fine. Throw away exploration, start with TDD. |
| "Test hard = design unclear" | Listen to the test. Hard to test = hard to use. |
| "TDD will slow me down" | TDD faster than debugging. Pragmatic = test-first. |
| "Manual test faster" | Manual doesn't prove edge cases. You'll re-test every change. |
| "Existing code has no tests" | You're improving it. Add tests for the code you touch. |

## TDD Rationale (why order matters)

Used by Step 4 to defend the RED-before-GREEN gate against the "tests-after achieve the same goals" row above.

### "I'll write tests after to verify it works"

Tests written after code pass immediately. Passing immediately proves nothing:

- Might test the wrong thing
- Might test implementation, not behavior
- Might miss edge cases you forgot
- You never saw it catch the bug

Test-first forces you to see the test fail, proving it actually tests something.

### "I already manually tested all the edge cases"

Manual testing is ad-hoc. You think you tested everything but:

- No record of what you tested
- Can't re-run when code changes
- Easy to forget cases under pressure
- "It worked when I tried it" ≠ comprehensive

Automated tests are systematic. They run the same way every time.

### "Deleting X hours of work is wasteful"

Sunk cost fallacy. The time is already gone. Your choice now:

- Delete and rewrite with TDD (high confidence)
- Keep it and add tests after (low confidence, likely bugs)

The "waste" is keeping code you can't trust.

### "TDD is dogmatic, being pragmatic means adapting"

TDD IS pragmatic:

- Finds bugs before commit (faster than debugging after)
- Prevents regressions (tests catch breaks immediately)
- Documents behavior (tests show how to use code)
- Enables refactoring (change freely, tests catch breaks)

"Pragmatic" shortcuts = debugging in production = slower.

### "Tests after achieve the same goals — it's spirit not ritual"

No. Tests-after answer "What does this do?" Tests-first answer "What should this do?"

Tests-after are biased by your implementation. You test what you built, not what's required. Tests-first force edge case discovery before implementing.

## TDD Cycle Detail

The RED/GREEN/REFACTOR mechanics referenced by Step 4 §1–§4.

### RED — Write Failing Test

Write one minimal test showing what should happen.

**Good test:**
```python
def test_retries_failed_operations_3_times():
    attempts = 0
    def operation():
        nonlocal attempts
        attempts += 1
        if attempts < 3:
            raise Exception('fail')
        return 'success'

    result = retry_operation(operation)

    assert result == 'success'
    assert attempts == 3
```

Clear name, tests real behavior, one thing.

**Bad test:**
```python
def test_retry_works():
    mock = MagicMock()
    mock.side_effect = [Exception(), Exception(), 'success']
    result = retry_operation(mock)
    assert result == 'success'  # What about retry count? Timing?
```

Vague name, tests mock not real code.

**Requirements:**

- One behavior per test
- Clear descriptive name ("and" in name? Split it)
- Real code, not mocks (unless truly unavoidable)
- Name describes behavior, not implementation

### Verify RED — Watch It Fail

**MANDATORY. Never skip.**

Run the specific test with the terminal tool:
```bash
pytest tests/test_feature.py::test_specific_behavior -v
```

Confirm:

- Test fails (not errors from typos)
- Failure message is expected
- Fails because the feature is missing

**Test passes immediately?** You're testing existing behavior. Fix the test.

**Test errors?** Fix the error, re-run until it fails correctly.

### GREEN — Minimal Code

Write the simplest code to pass the test. Nothing more.

**Good:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b  # Nothing extra
```

**Bad:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    logging.info(f"Adding {a} + {b} = {result}")  # Extra!
    return result
```

Don't add features, refactor other code, or "improve" beyond the test.

**Cheating is OK in GREEN:**

- Hardcode return values
- Copy-paste
- Duplicate code
- Skip edge cases

We'll fix it in REFACTOR.

### Verify GREEN — Watch It Pass

**MANDATORY.**
```bash
# Run the specific test
pytest tests/test_feature.py::test_specific_behavior -v
# Then run ALL tests to check for regressions
pytest tests/ -q
```

Confirm:

- Test passes
- Other tests still pass
- Output pristine (no errors, warnings)

**Test fails?** Fix the code, not the test.

**Other tests fail?** Fix regressions now.

### REFACTOR — Clean Up

After green only:

- Remove duplication
- Improve names
- Extract helpers
- Simplify expressions

Keep tests green throughout. Don't add behavior.

**If tests fail during refactor:** Undo immediately. Take smaller steps.

### Repeat

Next failing test for next behavior. One cycle at a time.
