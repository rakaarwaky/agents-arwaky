# Procedure — Grounded Citations

① **Reset the ledger** at the start of a task that will produce a grounded
answer or document. Skip the reset when continuing work whose ids are already
in a draft — reusing the ledger keeps the numbering stable.

② **Register every source at retrieval time.** After each `web_search` /
`web_extract` / `browser_navigate` / fetch, pass the URLs to `sources.py add`
(or pipe the raw JSON through `sources.py ingest`). Do this *before* writing
prose. Registering later, from memory, is the failure mode this skill exists
to prevent.

③ **Write cite-while-drafting.** Place the bracketed id(s) immediately after
each sentence the source supports:

```text
Ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water.[1][2]
```

④ **Append the Sources block** with `sources.py render --cited-in <draft>` so
the id → URL mapping is generated mechanically from the ledger, not retyped.
For non-markdown targets pick the matching `--style` and follow
`references/citation-formats.md` for placement (footnotes in docx, endnotes in
PDF/LaTeX, a Sources slide in decks, per-page source lists in wiki output).

⑤ **Verify before delivering** — `sources.py verify <draft>` exits non-zero
on unknown ids, on a Sources block that disagrees with the ledger, or (with
`--min-coverage`) on prose that is too thinly cited. Fix and re-run.

⑥ **Chat answers** follow the same steps with the draft in your reply:
register sources, cite inline, end with the rendered `Sources:` list. For a
short answer you may render the block from `sources.py render --only <ids>`
instead of writing to a file.
